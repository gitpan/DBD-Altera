                             DBD::Altera

               A DBD driver for Altera SQL Server
               ----------------------------------

                      Initial release 0.09
                      --------------------

 To install, execute the following commands:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

 This will take care of installing the driver at the correct place in the
 perl directory tree.

 The driver is a single perl module; there is no XS, no compilation involved,
 so there is nothing that can go wrong with the installation. After completing
 the installation, you should read the POD (run 'perldoc DBD::Altera') to
 familiarize yourself with the peculiarities of this driver. A good working
 knowledge of DBI is indispensable, because no tutorial or other help is
 included. Visit the DBI homepage at http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI 
 to find out more.

 This is the initial release of the driver. It could misbehave in various ways.
 (That's why it's not 1.00; because it may lack a final touch).
